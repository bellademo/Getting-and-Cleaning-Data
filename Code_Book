The Run_Analysis.R Script manipulates and cleans the data for the UCI HAR Dataset.
It performs the following actions:
  1. Downloads the dataset
    Extracts the UCI HAR Dataset
  
  2. Assign the data to the corresponding variables
    features <- "UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt"
    activities <- "UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt"
    subject_test <- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"
    x_test <- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"
    y_test <- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt"
    subject_train <- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt"
    x_train <- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt"
    y_train <- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt"
    
  3. Merge the data sets
    x_df <- merge x_train and x_test by rbind()
    y_df <- merge y_train and y_test by rbind()
    subject <- merge subject_train and subject_test by rbind()
    merge_df <- merge subject, y_df, and x_df by cbind()
    
  4. Extract the mean and standard deviation
    tidy_df <- subset merge_df and select columns: subject, code and the
    means and SDs for them
    
  5. Re-Label with descriptive names
    "Acc" to "Acceleromter"
    "Gyro" to "Gyroscope"
    "BodyBody" to "Body"
    "Mag" to "Magnitude"
    "^t" to "Time"
    "^f" to "Frequency"
    "tBody" to "TimeBody"
    "-mean()" to "Mean"
    "-std()" to "STD"
    "-freq()" to "Frequency"
    "angle" to "Angle"
    "gravity" to "Gravity"
    
  6. Create independent tidy data set with average for each activity and each subject
    final_df <- summarize tidy_df, group by subject and activity, take mean for each 
    export final_df into a FinalData.txt file
